# Deep Learning Specialization

**This repo contains the source-code and results of the deep learning course I am taking in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). The course series include five courses.**


### COURSE 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

If you want to break into cutting-edge AI, this course will help you do so. Deep learning engineers are highly sought after, and mastering deep learning will give you numerous new career opportunities. Deep learning is also a new "superpower" that will let you build AI systems that just weren't possible a few years ago. 

In this course, you will learn the foundations of deep learning. When you finish this class, you will:
- Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
- Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks 
- Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks 
- Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture 

This course also teaches you how Deep Learning actually works, rather than presenting only a cursory or surface-level description. So after completing it, you will be able to apply deep learning to a your own applications. If you are looking for a job in AI, after this course you will also be able to answer basic interview questions. 

This is the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization.

1. #### [Week 1: Introduction to deep learning](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week1IntroductionPractice)
- [ ] Be able to explain the major trends driving the rise of deep learning, and understand where and how it is applied today.

2. #### [Week 2: Neural Networks Basics](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week2LogisticRegressionPractice)
- [ ] Learn to set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset. Learn to use vectorization to speed up your models.

3. #### [Week 3: Shallow neural networks](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week3ShallowNNPractice)
- [ ] Learn to build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.

4. #### [Week 4: Deep Neural Networks](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week4DeepNNPractice)
- [ ] Understand the key computations underlying deep learning, use them to build and train deep neural networks, and apply it to computer vision.


### COURSE 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization

This course will teach you the "magic" of getting deep learning to work well. Rather than the deep learning process being a black box, you will understand what drives performance, and be able to more systematically get good results. You will also learn TensorFlow. 

After 3 weeks, you will: 
- Understand industry best-practices for building deep learning applications. 
- Be able to effectively use the common neural network "tricks", including initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, Batch normalization, gradient checking, 
- Be able to implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence. 
- Understand new best-practices for the deep learning era of how to set up train/dev/test sets and analyze bias/variance
- Be able to implement a neural network in TensorFlow. 

This is the second course of the Deep Learning Specialization.

1. #### [Week 1: Practical aspects of Deep Learning](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week5Practice)

2. #### [Week 2: Optimization algorithms](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week6Practice)

3. #### [Week 3: Hyperparameter tuning, Batch Normalization and Programming Frameworks](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week7Practice)


### COURSE 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects

You will learn how to build a successful machine learning project. If you aspire to be a technical leader in AI, and know how to set direction for your team's work, this course will show you how.

Much of this content has never been taught elsewhere, and is drawn from my experience building and shipping many deep learning products. This course also has two "flight simulators" that let you practice decision-making as a machine learning project leader. This provides "industry experience" that you might otherwise get only after years of ML work experience.

After 2 weeks, you will: 
- Understand how to diagnose errors in a machine learning system, and 
- Be able to prioritize the most promising directions for reducing error
- Understand complex ML settings, such as mismatched training/test sets, and comparing to and/or surpassing human-level performance
- Know how to apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning

I've seen teams waste months or years through not understanding the principles taught in this course. I hope this two week course will save you months of time.

This is a standalone course, and you can take this so long as you have basic machine learning knowledge. This is the third course in the Deep Learning Specialization.

1. #### [Week 1: ML Strategy (1)](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week8ML_Strategy_Practice)
