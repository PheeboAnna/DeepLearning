# Deep Learning Specialization

This repo contains the source-code and results of the deep learning course I am taking in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). The course series include five courses.


### COURSE 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

1. #### [Week 1: Introduction to deep learning](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week1IntroductionPractice)
- [ ] Be able to explain the major trends driving the rise of deep learning, and understand where and how it is applied today.

2. #### [Week 2: Neural Networks Basics](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week2LogisticRegressionPractice)
- [ ] Learn to set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset. Learn to use vectorization to speed up your models.

3. #### [Week 3: Shallow neural networks](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week3ShallowNNPractice)
- [ ] Learn to build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.

4. #### [Week 4: Deep Neural Networks](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week4DeepNNPractice)
- [ ] Understand the key computations underlying deep learning, use them to build and train deep neural networks, and apply it to computer vision.


### COURSE 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
> This course will teach you the "magic" of getting deep learning to work well. Rather than the deep learning process being a black box, you will understand what drives performance, and be able to more systematically get good results. You will also learn TensorFlow.

1. #### [Week 1: Practical aspects of Deep Learning](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week5Practice)

2. #### [Week 2: Optimization algorithms](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week6Practice)

3. #### [Week 3: Hyperparameter tuning, Batch Normalization and Programming Frameworks](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week7Practice)

### COURSE 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects

### COURSE 4: Convolutional Neural Networks

### COURSE 5: Sequence Models
