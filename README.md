# Deep Learning Specialization

This repo contains the source-code and results of the deep learning course I am taking in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). The course series include five courses.


### COURSE 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

> If you want to break into cutting-edge AI, this course will help you do so. Deep learning engineers are highly sought after, and mastering deep learning will give you numerous new career opportunities. Deep learning is also a new "superpower" that will let you build AI systems that just weren't possible a few years ago.

1. #### [Week 1: Introduction to deep learning](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week1IntroductionPractice)
- [ ] Be able to explain the major trends driving the rise of deep learning, and understand where and how it is applied today.

2. #### [Week 2: Neural Networks Basics](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week2LogisticRegressionPractice)
- [ ] Learn to set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset. Learn to use vectorization to speed up your models.

3. #### [Week 3: Shallow neural networks](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week3ShallowNNPractice)
- [ ] Learn to build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.

4. #### [Week 4: Deep Neural Networks](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week4DeepNNPractice)
- [ ] Understand the key computations underlying deep learning, use them to build and train deep neural networks, and apply it to computer vision.


### COURSE 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization

> This course will teach you the "magic" of getting deep learning to work well. Rather than the deep learning process being a black box, you will understand what drives performance, and be able to more systematically get good results. You will also learn TensorFlow.

1. #### [Week 1: Practical aspects of Deep Learning](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week5Practice)
- [ ] Be able to Understand industry best-practices for building deep learning applications. 

2. #### [Week 2: Optimization algorithms](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week6Practice)
- [ ] Be able to effectively use the common neural network "tricks", including initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, Batch normalization, gradient checking, 
- [ ] Be able to implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence.

3. #### [Week 3: Hyperparameter tuning, Batch Normalization and Programming Frameworks](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week7Practice)
- [ ] Be able to Understand new best-practices for the deep learning era of how to set up train/dev/test sets and analyze bias/variance - Be able to implement a neural network in TensorFlow. This is the second course of the Deep Learning Specialization.

### COURSE 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects

> You will learn how to build a successful machine learning project. If you aspire to be a technical leader in AI, and know how to set direction for your team's work, this course will show you how.

1. #### [Week 1: ML Strategy (1)](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week8ML_Strategy_Practice)
- [ ] Understand how to diagnose errors in a machine learning system, and - Be able to prioritize the most promising directions for reducing error - Understand complex ML settings, such as mismatched training/test sets, and comparing to and/or surpassing human-level performance 

2. #### [Week 2: ML Strategy (2)](https://github.com/ShujunHuang2019/DeepLearning/tree/master/Week9ML_Strategy_Practice)
- [ ] Know how to apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning I've seen teams waste months or years through not understanding the principles taught in this course.

### COURSE 4: Convolutional Neural Networks

### COURSE 5: Sequence Models
